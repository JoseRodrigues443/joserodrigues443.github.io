# Introduction

A InterPlanetary File System based blog post platform

This project aims to show how it's possible to deploy a static website using the IPFS protocol.

Normally a static website is created using regular HTML or Frameworks like Jekyll, Hugo, Next.js, Gatsaby or even Vuepress. After that a webserver (nginx, or others) would provide that website.

That is problematic because is a centralised system that can fail and isso not public.

IPFS comes to the rescue providing a flow that is decentralised and can be maintained by the community forever.
